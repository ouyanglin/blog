  <p>Hi, my name's Lin and this is my personal blog. After completing Michael Hartl's <a href="http://railstutorial.org">Rails Tutorial</a>, I thought I'd try making a blog from scratch. This is the result.</p>
  <p>You can find me on the web in a lot of places. Try <a href="http://twitter.com/TeamFTF">Twitter</a> for starters.</p>
